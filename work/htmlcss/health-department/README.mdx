## HTML and CSS files

Feel free to modify and extend the **CSS** code to your needs.

You can also extend the **HTML** code by adding new attributes or elements,
but make sure you **don't delete** existing elements and attributes.
Otherwise, the tests we will use for scoring may fail.

Use the HTML and CSS files provided in the `work/htmlcss/health-department/src` folder.
**Do not create or modify any files outside of this directory for this task.**

## Scoring

For scoring, we will use automated End-to-End tests to verify that the functionality works as expected.
You can also run the same tests that we will use to verify your score.

To run the tests, open a terminal and `cd` into the `work/htmlcss/health-department` directory.
Then, execute the following command in your terminal:

- `npm run start`
- wait for cypress to start (it might take a bit of time initially)
- select the `health-department.spec.js`-testsuite
- a chrome window will open and the tests will run
- click the "Run all tests"-Button or reload the page to rerun the test
- select or hover over a test or assertion in the left sidebar to see the HTML at that specific point in time
